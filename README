Simulated boots
==============

This programs simulates boot in on both bare metal and xen.
The goal of the code is to illustrate an issue of dead code
and how we can fix this.

Emulate bare metal boot:

./main

Emulate xen boot:

./main -x

TODO
====

You should see that using './main -x' fails to boot right now.
We are not sure when this will be fixed. Our goal is to illustrate
how to fix this using the infrastructure we've developed.

Once we have a xen hook for init routines we can show how we can
block kasan from running at all as its not yet ready for xen but
also that we can use this stuff to later also de-activate code
we know should *not run at all* on Xen. For instance the memory
setup code. Right now we'd have code split up in two different
places, or checks with things like pv_enabled() on Linux -- in
this code booting_xen() is used. We can replace these conditionals
as well later with a proper init structure annotation.
